### Important Information Regarding Schoology Plus
---

**TL;DR:** LAUSD is updating the Schoology interface on December 15, which will cause Schoology Plus to function incorrectly until the next version.

---

On December 15, LAUSD is updating Schoology for all users ([click here for more info](https://lms.lausd.net/school/424392825)). This will result in significant changes to the Schoology interface (notably the navigation bar at the top of the page), breaking many of the features of Schoology Plus. This change will take place ***during winter break***, so hopefully it will not be a major inconvenience. Nonetheless, we will be working hard to get a working version of Schoology Plus out as soon as possible after the update. Thank you for understanding.
