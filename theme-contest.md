### Schoology Plus Theme Creation Contest

***Want your theme to be included in Schoology Plus?***

Then enter the theme creation contest! We want to add more themes to Schoology Plus, and we want them to be made by our users! 

The contest is simple: 

1. Create a theme using the [theme editor](https://github.com/aopell/SchoologyPlus/wiki/Accessing-the-Theme-Editor)
2. [Copy the theme to your clipboard](https://github.com/aopell/SchoologyPlus/wiki/Sharing-a-Theme)
3. Submit it to [this form](https://forms.gle/bTJaHBqqZLmhmBMG6) by **May 31, 2019 at 11:59 PM PDT**

We'll pick our favorites and bundle them (giving credit to you of course!) in all future versions of Schoology Plus! We'll also send out an announcement with the results of the competition. Good luck!
